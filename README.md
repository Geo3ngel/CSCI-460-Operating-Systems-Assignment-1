# CSCI-460-Operating-Systems-Assignment-1
## The Bridger Canyon Drive Construction Project
Assignment Due: Wednesday, October 16th, 2019

# Design

## I/O:
For my input arguements, I use the following formating: `./run_me` `number_of_cars` `threshold` `direction_change_limit` `seed`
    
    - `./run_me`: just the executable generated by my make file in src.
    - `number_of_cars`: the amount of cars to be generated for the simulation.
    - `threshold`: the maximum amount of cars the `one way` can handle at a given time.
    - `direction_change_limit`: the maxiumum amount of cars that can go in a row before the direction is changed to allow for cars heading the other direction to go.
    - `seed`: the seed used for randomly generating new car's directions.

Alternatively, the program can be run with just `./run_me` and will be set to the following default values:

    - `number_of_cars`: 100
    - `threshold`: 10
    - `direction_change_limit`: 15
    - `seed`: determined by system time

As for the output, things are color coded with respect to what action is occuring.

    - Blue is for a new Car that has just been generated.
    - Magenta for those that have just arrived at the one way.
    - Green for when a Car is put onto the one way.
    - Cyan for when a car is on the one way.
    - Yellow for when a car successfully exits the one way

It is also worth noting that any print out mentioning a car here includes it's ID and DIRECTION.

Direction Changes, remaining cars on the one way, and direction changes are all in plain white text.

## Synchronization:

Note: the direction_change_limit does not make use of any kind of management thread. (There is no 'bridgemanager' thread, as per the requirements)

There is no bridgemanager thread, or anything of the sort, however to keep from forcing cars to wait until every other car going the opposite direction has gone, I do use a value taken in as an arguement (`direction_change_limit`) to limit the amount of cars going the same direction that can be added to the one way in a row before the direction is changed.

## Safety:

An instance where two cars going the opposite direction enter the one way is prevented by a pthread_cond_timedwait function inside of a while loop that prevents the car from being able to progress to the state of entering the one way until the the current direction of traffic matches that car's direction.

Additionally, when the direction is being changed, a condition is set that won't allow any cars to move onto the one way. This condition stays in effect until there are no more cars on the one way, and is then cleared, allowing traffic flow to resume.

Due to the strict ruling described above, if there where any errors, it would have to come from deprivation of resources (starvation), causing a dead lock by resources not being handled properly. However after extensive testing, I can say with 100% certainty that is not occuring.

As for avoiding one-way collapses, the while loop includes a condition for when the current count of cars on the one way are at the threshold of what we want to allow. Thus it will stay in the while loop and continue calling it's timed wait condition function until all the conditions are matched.

All count variable modification and access are under the protection of a locked mutex, so there is no need to worry about values being duplicated, read before updating, etc.

Clarification: The conditions for the while loop to pass allowing a car to enter the one way are as follows:
 - The amount of cars on the one way must be under it's threshold.
 - The direction the car is going must face the current flow of traffic.
 - The `draining condition` boolean variable must not be set to true; which means to say we are not in the middle of waiting for all the cars on the one way to exit before changing the direction of traffic on the one way.

## Liveness:

Once the cars get on the one way, they show they are present on it, and then leave the one way. There are some mutex locks on the leaving portion for iterating important variables, however those values will always eventually be avalible thanks to the usage of timed wait conditions in other areas of the code. Thus gaurenteeing they make it.

Also, there is a counter that keeps track of the cars that have finished exiting the one way successfully, which reports the amount of cars that crossed after the threads join, which has consistently reported back the apropriate value, ensuring my code works as intended.

If cars are waiting still, and the one way is empty, the direction will be changed to allow those cars to enter the one way. This is done by an if statement in the while loop that dictates each car's ability to enter the one way. This does result however in seemingly unnecessary switching at times, seeing as multiple threads can meet this condition allowing for more direction changes than the ideal. However this is difficult if not impossible to manage syncronioustly while also expecting the flow of traffic to be reasonably fair.

## Efficiency

Multiple cars are allowed on the one way at a time, so long as they are going in the same direction and the one way is under it's maximum capacity.

Once cars leave the one way, more are immidiently able to fill in, provided they are going the same direction.

This will continue to occur until the `direction_change_limit` is met, which will result in the blocking of cars entering the one way until it is empty, followed by the direction of the flow of traffic being reversed. 

This way other cars heading in the opposite direction can be allowed to go for a while without having to wait for every single car from the other side to go across first.

# Testing Methods

## Dead lock testing:

    Consisted of running the code with different seeds and input variable sizes to see if it froze up anywhere.

    If it did freeze, I'd then take a look at the most recent of the color coded print statements to get an idea of simulations status at that point, to infer what caused the dead lock.

    This occured a good bit when I was figuring out the best ordering of my mutex variables, but was consistently simple to track down the cause of.

## Live lock testing: 

    As for livelock testing, the process was more or less the same as what I did for dead lock testing, however rather than just a hang, I'd be looking for endlessly repeating print statements.

    This approach could very much be improved upon, seeing as there was a case where live lock occured where I didn't have any prints occuring, fooling me to beleive it was a deadlock issue for a while.

    The cause being fixed in the project's current iteration, of course.

## Ensuring against Starvation

    - For the method of how I prevent this, see Safety & Liveness sections

    To ensure that we don't have issues of no resource forfeiture, I simply follow the order of the color coded print statements from my results, which make it reasonably simple to see if all the cars heading to Bozeman are going through the one way before the ones heading to Belgrade are.

## Ensuring Values:

    I was sure to keep track of how manny cars had crossed the one way to make sure there weren't any being dropped or left out.

    This value is presented as the total cars crossed at the end of every run.

    To ensure the amount of cars currently on the one way, I printed out the amont currently on the one way preceided by the car's actions, making it easy to trace what had occured, as to infer what should be what when.

## Handling Race Conditions:

    - See the Safety & Liveness sections of the Design portion before continuing.

# Testing Examples

## Sampling sizes used to check for errors:
- 10 cars: Initial size when building up the basic bones of the project to ensure counters functioned as intended, car where generated properly, etc.

- 20 cars: For ltheseight mutex lock testing, in which I mostly wanted to be sure there weren't dead/live locks occuring between changes to the code base

- 100 cars: For ensuring starvation dosen't occur in such a manner that allows cars going in one direction to all go before allowing for any of the cars going the other direction to go.

- 1,000 cars: More of the saem for the few above, just a high level of scrutiny.

- 10,000 cars: Stress testing, and to be absolutely certain there where no livelock/deadlock issues.

## Additional Parameter Choice Range:
I usually used a small threshold for the one way's max car limit, keeping it between 10 to 20.

The amount of cars to allow between direction changes however varied typically between 10 and 100. (refering to the `direction change limit`)

The seed I would change from time to time aswell, though would keep consistent when testing a particular area.

## Examples:

### Smaller Example:
Running the command with the following parameters: `./run_me 20 7 5 404`

which is to say we use 10 cars, setting the one way's max car capacity as 3, our `direction change limit` as 4, and our seed as 404.

OUTPUT:
![small](src/small_sim1.png)
![small](src/small_sim2.png)

These screen shots should display the color coding mentioned before, for each action performed on a Car. Though such screen shots would be difficult to capture a larger run as done below.

### Larger Example:
Running the command with the following parameters: `./run_me 100 10 15 404`

which is to say we use 100 cars, setting the one way's max car capacity as 10, our `direction change limit` as 15, and our seed as 404.

yeilds the following print out: (NOTE: Color dosen't carry over)

SIMULATION SETTINGS:
1) Initializing with 100 Cars.
2) Maximum # of cars allowed on the one-way: 10
3) Maximum # of cars per one-way cycle: 15
